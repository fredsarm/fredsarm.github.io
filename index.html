      <h2>Full Stack Developer</h2>
      <img id="fredsphoto" src="./media/fotoPortifolio.png" alt="Frederico Sarmento's picture.">
      <p>Hello! My name is Frederico Sarmento, a full stack developer student at Codecademy, logging in from Brazil. This project is part of the full stack engineer path.</p>
      <p>Since the beginning of my professional life, I've been creating things using a computer and basic office software, like Ms Excel and Ms Access. In all of them, I explored the programming resources like VBA, Excel' s conditional functions, SQL language to manipulate data and all those fascinating stuff, also creating more sophisticated apps using forms in Ms Access via LAN and helping the staff to control some administrative routines.</p>
      <p>Since 2013, I've begun creating programs with the RAD tool Scriptcase. It helped me to find many solutions, generating software based on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and PostgreSQL databases. But it was still very limited because I didn't know how to personalize the results and feel the necessity of learning true full stack development techniques and route my path through this profession more effectively.</p>
      <p>This way, I began to study full stack engineer in august, 2021, and have been learning more each day.</p>
      <p>So, this is my portfolio. Here, I'll show you some projects and something about me, as a professional.</p>
