    <h1>Biography</h1>

    <p>My professional life is divided in some periods. From my 17 years old, I began to think about support myself. So
      I
      formed a rock band to play in Rio's night life. That was my most obvious choice, I had good skills in musical
      instruments and singing. But the reality made me change my mind.</p>
    <p>When the dream period passed, I decided to go to university, leaving Music as a hobby, just a pleasurable
      activity.
      So, in 1990, I joined University Gama Filho, which at that time was the largest private university in Latin
      America.
      My choice was Law.</p>
    <p>Despite it not having to do with my vocations, I was very interested in getting to know the law and, I wondered,
      work
      in this area such as Advocacy, Magistracy, Prosecution Office etc.</p>
    <p>Upon finishing the course and graduating in Law, I started the forensic internship. As I had to write many
      documents,
      I bought an old fashioned typewriter machine 😄 and began my typing training.🫣</p>
    <p>My brother, who had been coped with computers since 1985, when saw that odd decision, gave me a PC Intel 386 and
      a
      dot matrix printer, a moment from which I fell in love with this magic device.</p>
    <p>Immediately, I changed my career to an entrepreneur in that area, setting up in 1996 a small wholesale company in
      the
      technology branch.</p>
    <p>In that time, I begin to develop some solutions in Excel using the Solver add-on. One of them was a sheet that
      calculated the quantity of metal scrap we had to add to get a precisely defined metal alloy. It received a sheet
      with
      the compound of metals stored in the factory and another one that defined the restrictions (the composition of the
      metal alloy you wanted to the foundry). The sheet calculated, using iterations, the best combination of materials
      and
      their quantity to achieve the wanted composition.</p>
    <p>While learning to operate other Office Software like MS Word, MS Access, I developed skills in programming with
      that
      add-ons. With VBA, SQL Language and Excel's Math and conditional functions, I implemented many control apps for
      registering numbers and activities and access reports that was fundamental to have a panoramic view of the
      situation.
    </p>
    <p>In 2002, I got the opportunity to work to an events' management company as an administrative consultant and
      integrated, in this role, many skills that I developed before, giving advises about which ERP software to
      purchase,
      which infrastructure of LAN to implement, which way to configure some new small business, aspects like the best
      fiscal
      and tributary options, also agreements in a wide variety of jurisdictions, letters of attorney and many other
      areas,
      even familiar subjects.</p>
    <p>In all of those functions I used my knowledge on office software, creating small apps with MS Access to help me
      with
      my activities. So the passion for programming was present in my path and I planed of learning real programming
      technics and work professionally with them.</p>
    <p>From 2004 I started many courses in a great variety of stuffs for example basic accountancy, cost accounting,
      inventory control, financial management (accounts payable, process' routines of bank reconciliation) financial
      math,
      library management, logical reasoning, general knowledge (current events), economics, writing essay (Portuguese),
      statistic, public administration.</p>
    <p>I also built a house following closely all the procedure, managing purchases and price quotes and creating the
      project.
      I used the software 3D Home Architect (for Windows), forms and SQL queries in Access.</p>
    <p>In 2009 was the time to realize an old dream: to record an <a href="https://soundcloud.com/freddoliveiras"
        target="_blank">album (click here)</a> with some of my songs.</p>
    <p>For that, I learned to operate some musical software like Cakewalk Sonar, EZ-Drummer, Melodyne, Waves, iZotope
      Ozone
      and others, beside some equipment related to the project.</p>
    <p>In 2013 I started working, as a partner, in a metallurgical Industry, Wekstätten Commerce and Industry, in Rio de
      Janeiro. As I wanted to create more professional ERP software, I purchased a subscription of a RAD. With it, I
      could
      improve my database knowledge, studying PostgreSQL in depth and database structures. The system automatically
      creates
      software in HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, Ajax. It also connect the front end to a PostgreSQL databases. In that
      period, I've done a Linux course. Today it is my OS of the heart.</p>
    <p>In the Wekstätten period, I've also knew the basics of Solid Works, a software of dreams, that is in my list of
      things to study. My purpose is to build some gadgets that I concept mentally and don't have a way to draw.</p>
    <p>In 2018, I started a small clothes store, Boutonné Moda, and put in practice all my skills using the RAD tool and
      also
      learned the fantastic GIMP while preparing marketing stuff to post it online.</p>
    <p>An interesting experience was working with online stores. The Magento is fantastic, with all its concept and
      power. I've learn to registering a domain, set up a hosting service in <a
        href="http://a2hosting.com">a2hosting.com</a>, install a certificate,
      dedicated
      virtual server, installing and adjusting all needed software (Linux CentOS 6, Apache with all the necessary
      modules,
      SSH server, PostgreSQL Database Server, email server, Magento with theme, payment and freight modules). I also
      learned
      to operate the system as a user adding pictures, creating categories, menus, fulfilling all fields and exploring
      the
      resources of the system. It's not an easy task. I sweated. My limit was not having programming knowledge for
      customizing the system.</p>
    <p>The RAD is still limited. For this reason, in 2021, I decided to learn programming in a complete manner and
      enrolled
      in Full Stack Engineer online course at the new yorker school Codecademy.</p>
    <p>Since than, I've been studying hard to learn programming in depth and dedicate the next 120 years 😲 of my life
      to
      this job.🤞🏻🙏🏻</p>
