    <h1>Biography</h1>
    <p>My professional life is divided in some periods.</p>

    <p>From my 17 years old, I began to worry about my own suport and formed a rock band to play on Rio's night life.
      That was my most obvious choice, given the fact that I had good skills in musical instruments and singing.</p>

    <p>When the dream period passed, I decided to go to university, leaving Music as a hobby, just a pleasurable
      activity. So, in 1990, I joined University Gama Filho, which at that time was the largest private university in
      Latin America. My choice was Law. Despite not having to do with my vocations, I was very interested in getting to
      know the law and, I wondered, work in this area such as Law, Magistracy, Parquet etc.</p>

    <p>Upon finishing the course and graduating in Law, I started the forensic internship. As I had to write many
      documents, I bought an old fashioned typewiter machine ðŸ˜„ and began my typing training.ðŸ«£</p>
    <p>My brother, who had been coped with computers since 1985, when saw that odd decision, gave me a PC, Intel 386, a
      moment from which I fell in love with this magic device.</p>

    <p>Imediatly, I changed ma career to an entrepener in that area, setting up in 1996 a small wholesale company in the
      technology branch.</p>

    <p>While learning to operate Office Software like MS Word, MS Access, MS Excel, I developed skills in programming
      with that add ins, out of the box, kind VBA, SQL Language and Excel's Math functions. I implemented many control
      apps for registering numbers and activities and access reports that was fundamental in the following years of my
      business adventure.</p>

    <p>In 2002, I got the oportunity to work to an event's management company as an adminstrative consultor and could
      join, in this role, many skills that I developed before, giving advises about buying music production softwares
      like Sonnar, Sound Forge, about which ERP softwares to buy, which infrastructure of LAN to implement, which way to
      configure some new small busines, aspects like the best fiscal and tributary options, also agreements in a wide
      variaty of jurisdictions, letters of attorney and many other areas, even familiar subjects.</p>

    <p>In all of those functions I used my knowledge on office softwares, creating small softwares to help me with my
      activities. So the passion for programming was allways present in my path and I dreamed with learning real
      programming technics and work with that professionally.</p>

    <p>From 2004 started many courses in a great variaty of stuffs for example basic accountancy, cost accounting,
      inventory control, financial management like accounts payable, bank reconciliation process routines, financial
      math, library management, logical reasoning, general knowledge (current events), economics, writing essay
      (Portuguese), statistic, public administration.</p>

    <p>I also builded a house following closely all the procedure, managing purchases and price quotes and creating the
      project. I used the sofware 3D Home Arquitect (for Windows). Today I stell use it for some small projects (Linux).
    </p>

    <p>In 2013 I started working, as a partner, in a metallurgical Industry, WekstÃ¤tten Commerce and Industry, in Rio de
      Janeiro. As I wanted to create more professional ERP softwares, I purchased a subscription of the RAD sofware
      Scriptcase. With it, I could improuve my database knowledge, studying Postgresl in depth and database structures.
      The system automatically creates software in HTML, CSS, PHP, Javascript, Ajax. It also conect the front end to a
      Postgresql databases. Another professional achievement was Linux, my today's OS of the heart.</p>

    <p>In the WekstÃ¤tenn period, also knew the basics of Solid Works, a software of dreams, that is in my list of things
      to study. My purpose is to build some gadgets that I concept mentaly and don't have a way to draw.</p>


    <p>In 2018, I started a clothe's store, BoutonnÃ© Moda, and put in practice all my skills using Scriptcase and also
      learn the fantastic GIMP while preparing marketing stuff to post it online. In 2020 I had to close the doors
      because of the Coronavirus, It's problematic for people trying on clothes with the risk of death.</p>

    <p>A very insteresting experience was working with online stores. The Magento is fantastic, with all its concept and
      power. I've learn to registering a domain, set up a hosting service in a2host.com, certificate, dedicated virtual
      server, installing and adjusting all nedded software (Linux CentOS 6, Apache with all the necessary modules, SSH
      server, Postgresql Database Server, email server, Magento with theme, payment and freight modules). I also learned
      to operate the system as a user adding pictures, creating categories, menus, fullfilling all fields and exploring
      the resources of the system. It's not an easy task. I confess that I swet a lot.</p>

    <p>Scriptcase is stell limited. This way, in 2021, I decided to learn programming in a completely manner and
      enrolled in Full Stack Engineer online course at the new yorker school Codecademy.</p>

    <p>Since than, I've been studying hard to learn programming deeply and dedicate the next 120 years ðŸ˜² of my life to
      this job.</p>
