    <h1>Biography</h1>
    <p>My professional life is divided in some periods. From my 17 years old, I began to think about suport myself. So I
      formed a rock band to play in Rio's night life.
      That was my most obvious choice, I had good skills in musical instruments and singing. But the reality made me
      change my mind.</p>

    <p>When the dream period passed, I decided to go to university, leaving Music as a hobby, just a pleasurable
      activity. So, in 1990, I joined University Gama Filho, which at that time was the largest private university in
      Latin America. My choice was Law.
    <p> Despite it not having to do with my vocations, I was very interested in getting to
      know the law and, I wondered, work in this area such as Advocacy, Magistracy, Prosecution Office etc.</p>
    </p>
    <p>Upon finishing the course and graduating in Law, I started the forensic internship. As I had to write many
      documents, I bought an old fashioned typewiter machine üòÑ and began my typing training.ü´£</p>
    <p>My brother, who had been coped with computers since 1985, when saw that odd decision, gave me a PC, Intel 386,
      and a dot matrix printer, a moment from which I fell in love with this magic device.</p>

    <p>Imediatly, I changed my career to an entrepeneur in that area, setting up in 1996 a small wholesale company in
      the technology branch.</p>

    <p>In that time, I begin to develop some solutions in Excel using the Solver addon. One of them was a sheet that
      calculated the quantity of metal scrap we had to add to get a precisely defined matal alloy. It
      received a sheet with the compound of metals stored in the factory and another one that difined the restrictions
      (the composition of the metal alloy you wanted to the foundry). The sheet calculated, using iteractions, the best
      combination of materials and their quantity to achieve the wanted composition.</p>

    <p>While learning to operate other Office Software like MS Word, MS Access, I developed skills in programming with
      that addons. With VBA, SQL Language and Excel's Math and contitional functions, I implemented
      many control apps for registering numbers and activities and access reports that was fundamental to have a
      panoramic view of the situation.</p>

    <p>In 2002, I got the oportunity to work to an event's management company as an adminstrative consultor and could
      conect, in this role, many skills that I developed before, giving advises about buying music production softwares
      like Sonnar, Sound Forge, about which ERP softwares to purchase, which infrastructure of LAN to implement, which
      way to configure some new small busines, aspects like the best fiscal and tributary options, also agreements in a
      wide
      variaty of jurisdictions, letters of attorney and many other areas, even familiar subjects.</p>

    <p>In all of those functions I used my knowledge on office softwares, creating small apps with MS Access to
      help me with my activities. So the passion for programming was present in my path and I planed of learning real
      programming technics and work professionally with them.</p>

    <p>From 2004 I started many courses in a great variaty of stuffs for example basic accountancy, cost accounting,
      inventory control, financial management (accounts payable, process' routines of bank reconciliation) financial
      math, library management, logical reasoning, general knowledge (current events), economics, writing
      essay (Portuguese), statistic, public administration.</p>

    <p>I also builded a house following closely all the procedure, managing purchases and price quotes and creating the
      project. I used the sofware 3D Home Arquitect (for Windows), forms and sql queries in Access.
    </p>

    <p>In 2009 was the time to realize an old dream: to record an album with some of my songs. </p>
    <p>For that, I learned to operate some musical softwares like Cakewalk Sonar, EZ-Drummer, Melodyne, Waves, iZotope
      Ozone and others, beside some equipaments related to the project.</p>

    <p>In 2013 I started working, as a partner, in a metallurgical Industry, Wekst√§tten Commerce and Industry, in Rio de
      Janeiro. As I wanted to create more professional ERP softwares, I purchased a subscription of a RAD.
      With it, I could improuve my database knowledge, studying Postgresql in depth and database structures.
      The system automatically creates software in HTML, CSS, PHP, Javascript, Ajax. It also conect the front end to a
      Postgresql databases. Another professional achievement was Linux, my today's OS of the heart.</p>

    <p>In the Wekst√§tten period, I've also knew the basics of Solid Works, a software of dreams, that is in my list of
      things
      to study. My purpose is to build some gadgets that I concept mentaly and don't have a way to draw.</p>

    <p>In 2018, I started a clothe's store, Boutonn√© Moda, and put in practice all my skills using the RAD tool and also
      learned the fantastic GIMP while preparing marketing stuff to post it online. In 2020 I had to close the doors
      because of the Coronavirus, It's problematic for people trying on clothes with the risk of death.</p>

    <p>A very insteresting experience was working with online stores. The Magento is fantastic, with all its concept and
      power. I've learn to registering a domain, set up a hosting service in <a href="http://a2hosting.com"
        target="_blank">
        a2hosting.com</a>, install a certificate,
      dedicated virtual
      server, installing and adjusting all needed software (Linux CentOS 6, Apache with all the necessary modules, SSH
      server, Postgresql Database Server, email server, Magento with theme, payment and freight modules). I also learned
      to operate the system as a user adding pictures, creating categories, menus, fullfilling all fields and exploring
      the resources of the system. It's not an easy task. I sweated. My limit was not having programming knowledge for
      customizing the system.</p>

    <p>The RAD is stell limited. For this reason, in 2021, I decided to learn programming in a complete manner and
      enrolled in Full Stack Engineer online course at the new yorker school Codecademy.</p>

    <p>Since than, I've been studying hard to learn programming in depth and dedicate the next 120 years üò≤ of my life
      to this job.ü§ûüèªüôèüèª</p>
