    <h1>Code Features</h1>
    <h2>Resposive</h2>
    <p> I implemented a responsive code using only display property block and inline-block.</p>
    <img id="responsivepc" src="../media/responsivepc.png" alt="Print of the screen rendered in a PC">
    <img id="responsivemobile" src="../media/responsivemobile.jpeg" alt="Print of the screen rendered in a Mobile.">

    <h2>Stable</h2>
    <p>The main page, index.html, is the only one to be loaded. Other contents apears in an <code>embeded</code>
      element preventing reloads of the entire website on each click. This aproach avoid blinks while browsing and
      reduce
      the amount of data transferig through the net.</p>
    <p>The menu behavior was set up with JavaScript. There is an
      object storing the menus, as properties, and storing
      another object with 2 properies each one: the id and src attribute.
    </p>
    <p> A for...in statement iterates over the
      object and add an event listener for each menu.
    </p>
    <p>Before changing src propery, it turns the content transparent and gradually fade it in. This creates a soft
      effects to the transitions.</p>

    <h2>Constrast</h2>
    <p>The colors ware checked with <a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/" target="_blank">Contrast
        Checker</a> and
      distinguish
      all the
      elements.</p>
    <h2>Whatsapp</h2>
    <p>The way of contact is whatsapp, not email. JavaScript open the app with a link created with the address string
      concatenated
      with the message wrote in text field.</p>
