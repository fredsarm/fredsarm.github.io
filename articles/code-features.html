    <h1>Code Features</h1>
    <h2>Resposive</h2>
    <p>I implemented a responsive code using only display property block and inline-block. Certainly, there is more
      space
      to improve it.</p>
    <img id="responsivepc" src="../media/responsivepc.png" alt="Print of the screen rendered in a PC">
    <img id="responsivemobile" src="../media/responsivemobile.jpeg" alt="Print of the screen rendered in a Mobile.">
    <h2>Rendering Stability</h2>
    <p>The main page, index.html, is the only one to be loaded. Other contents appear in an embedded element preventing
      reloads of the entire website on each click. This approach avoid blinks while browsing and reduce the amount of
      data
      transferring through the net.</p>
    <p>The menu behavior was set up with JavaScript. There is an object storing the menus, as properties, and storing
      another object with 2 properties each one: the id and src attribute.</p>
    <p>A for...in statement iterates over the object and add an event listener for each menu.</p>
    <p>Before changing src property, it turns the content transparent and gradually fade it in. This creates a soft
      effects
      to the transitions.</p>
    <h2>Contrast</h2>
    <p>The colors were checked with <a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/" target="_blank">Contrast
        Checker</a> and distinguish all the elements.</p>
    <h2>WhatsApp</h2>
    <p>The way of contact is WhatsApp, not email. JavaScript open the app with a link created with the address string
      concatenated with the message wrote in text field.</p>
