    <h2>Full Stack Developer</h2>

    <p>Hello! My name is Frederico Sarmento, a full stack developer student at the new yorker course Codecademy, logging
      in
      from Brazil.</p>
    <p>This project is part of the Full Stack Engineer path. Its main purpose is to put in practice some technics that
      I've
      learned in the course and consolidate the knowledge.</p>
    <p>I tried to keep in mind the simplicity, choosing more general then specific CSS rules trying to structure the <a
        href="https://github.com/fredsarm/fredsarm.github.io/blob/master/style/style.css" target="_blank">CSS code</a>






      with a clear hierarchical format in a way that I could identify the exceptions in the style and prevent to
      have
      confusing revokes in the code.</p>
    <p>The HTML files, in the same simple fashion, has a dry DOM structure focusing on coding more clearly, avoiding too
      many divs.</p>
    <p>The display property is predominantly inline-block and block.</p>
    <p>So, this is my portfolio. Here, I'll show you some projects and something about me, as a professional.</p>
    <p>See the code at <a href="https://github.com/fredsarm/fredsarm.github.io" target="_blank">my
