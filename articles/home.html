    <p>Hello! My name is Frederico Sarmento, a full stack developer student at the new yorker course Codecademy, logging
      in from Brazil.</p>
    <p>This project is part of the Full Stack Engineer path. Its main purpose is to put in practise some technics that
      I've learned in the course and consolidate the knowledge.</p>
    <p>As my objective, until now, is focus on coding, I prefere to let the design and Ui/Ux area for another step.
    </p>
    <p>I tried to keep in mind the simplicity, chosing more general then specific css rules. I think, based on what I've
      learned until now, that is important to structure the css code with a clear hierarquical format in a way that I
      could identify the exceptions in the style and prevent to have confusing revokes in the code.</p>
    <p> The html files, in the same simple fashionn, has a dry DOM structure fucusing to code more consciously about the
      role of each element than just based on the result showed in the screen.
    </p>
    <p>The display property is predominantly inline-block and block. For now, I avoid to use flex and grid for the fact
      that they are modes that offer many resources that the basic setting doesn't offer. So as I'm still consolidate in
      mind the differences, I also let those modes for another step.
    </p>
    <p>So, this is my portfolio. Here, I'll show you some projects and something about me, as a professional.</p>
