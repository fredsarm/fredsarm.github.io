    <h1>Frederico Sarmento</h1>
    <h2>Full Stack Developer</h2>
    <img id="fredsphoto" src="../media/fotoPortfolio.png" alt="Frederico Sarmento's picture.">
    <p>Hello! My name is Frederico Sarmento, a full stack developer student at the new yorker course Codecademy, logging
      in from Brazil.</p>
    <p>This project is part of the Full Stack Engineer path. Its main purpose is to put in practise some technics that
      I've learned in the course and consolidate the knowledge.</p>
    <p>I tried to keep in mind the simplicity, chosing more general then specific css rules. I think, based on what I've
      learned until now, that is important to structure the css code with a clear hierarquical format in a way that I
      could identify the exceptions in the style and prevent to have confusing revokes in the code.</p>
    <p> The html files, in the same simple fashionn, has a dry DOM structure fucusing on coding more clearly, avoiding
      too many divs.
    </p>
    <p>The display property is predominantly inline-block and block.
    </p>
    <p>So, this is my portfolio. Here, I'll show you some projects and something about me, as a professional.</p>
